<h3>Key Differences from React Version</h3>
<br>
  <b>Framework Choice:</b>
<br>
  <pre>
Uses Vue 3 instead of React

Takes advantage of Vue's reactivity system and composition API

Still maintains all the same functionality

Implementation Details:

Uses Vue directives (v-if, v-for, v-model) instead of JSX

Leverages Vue's reactivity system with ref and computed

Uses Vue lifecycle hooks (onMounted, watch) instead of React's useEffect

Chart Integration:

Uses Recharts' imperative API for chart rendering

Manually handles chart updates when data changes

Adds resize event listener for responsive chart

Icon Handling:

Uses Lucide's icon creation API to render icons after mount

Dynamically renders icons based on icon names

State Management:

Uses Vue's reactivity system instead of React's useState

Maintains the same state structure and logic

Benefits of This Approach
No Build Step Required:

Works directly in the browser with CDN imports

Easier to deploy as a single HTML file

Smaller Footprint:

No React runtime needed

Vue's runtime is smaller than React's

Progressive Enhancement:

Can be easily integrated into existing projects

Doesn't require a full SPA architecture

Familiar Concepts:

Similar component-based approach to React

Reactive state management

This implementation provides all the same features as the React version while demonstrating how to build a modern web app without React.
